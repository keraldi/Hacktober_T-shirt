# A Poem

Verse 1
---

Colorful shirt  
Colorful skirt  
A shirt I wish  
Even if I find  
Not the time  
To prepare the dish  
It is still on my mind  
So I've prepared this rhyme  

Verse 2
---

I profess a cheat it is  
However, one would barely miss  
The chance to participate  
What everyone does is proliferate  
New issues, a new request  
To merge, to pull, at their behest  
For their own, selfish goal  
No foresight, no soul
